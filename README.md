# Image Processing
This project performs edge detection using Sobel and Roberts algorithms and also uses some MATLAB built-in edge detection functions (Sobel, Roberts, Canny, Zerocross) for this purpose. In addition, it applies various types of noise (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, Poisson, Speckle) to the sample images and displays them. After that, it removes the Gaussian noise using the Wiener2 filtering function and displays the results.
